        <p>You are a tinker fairy in the woods. Your job is to fix things around the fairy village but today is your only day off in years. <br/> 
            You have planned your whole day full of fun, relaxing activities. Before your day even started there was a loud knock on your door. <br/>
            It was Belle, an animal fairy. She looked quite disgrunteled and panicked. She didn't even greet you, 
            she just told you:</p>
        <p>"There has been an accident! The dam wall cracked and is leaking and water is flooding into the village!"</p>
        <p> You are shocked. If the crack is not fixed the dam wall will burst and flood the village!
        </p>
        <p>What do you do? Help, or Enjoy your day?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer02">
        <p>Answer Yes when you're ready!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err0">
        <p>Please answer 'yes' or 'no'.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer11">
        <p>What a noble choice! The village really needs your help!</p>
        <p>You tell Belle to go and evacute the houses closest to the wall. You go to grab all your tools but remember <br/>
            that Hennie borrowed some of your tools and you will need to go get them.</p>
        <p>You have most of the tools you think you will need but there are some that are still at Hennie's that you may need. <br/>
            Unfortunately, Hennie's house is on the other side of the village and if you do go you will take a lot longer to get to the dam wall.
        </p>
        <p>You have to decide: Go to Hennie's house to retrieve your tools or go straight to the dam wall and hope you don't need <br/>
            a tool that is in Hennie's possesion to fix the wall.</p>
        <p> What do you do? Go to Hennie's or Go straight to the dam wall?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You decide to enjoy your deserved off day and do all the activities you had planned.</p>
        <p> You start your day by going to the sports area to play some soccer with your fellow fairies. Soccer is something <br/>
            you have enjoyed to do since you were young and with all the work you've had to do the past few years you could only <br/>
            longingly watch the matches while you are fixing something in the vicinity or walking by.
        </p>
        <p> After a very exciting match you enjoy a nice stroll through the beautiful forest. You decide to go swimming in the lake <br/>
            with the beautiful waterfall. Just when you get to the edge of the village on your way to the lake you see all the houses <br/>
        that have been flooded and rush to help.</p>
        <p> Well, it seems like you won't be having that relaxing day after all with all the work that needs to be done to repair <br/>
            the village!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
        <p>Please answer 'help' or 'enjoy day'.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
        <p>You decide you need to have those tools that Hennie borrowed. You put on your travel boots, grab your largest <br/>
            bag and start walking the long road to his house.
        </p>
        <p>Once you get to Hennie's house you are relieved to find that Hennie has all of your tools. You take all your tools stuff them in the <br/>
            large bag and rush to the dam wall.
        </p>
        <p>Once you arrive you see it is not as bad as it could've been. You quickly get to work fixing the crack. You use all <br/>
            your tools including those that Hennie had borrowed. What a good choice to have gone and get them! You finish fixing the <br/>
            wall and there is still time to do some of your relaxing activities!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
        <p>You can't waste that time! What if the wall breaks and floods the village while you are walking to Hennie's house? <br/>
            You grab the tools you do have and rush to the wall. You see it is not as bad as you thought but it will need to be <br/>
            fixed ASAP otherwise the wall will break and all that water will flood the village!
        </p>
        <p>You get to work fixing the wall but then you realize you need those tools Hennie has!</p>
        <p>You send someone to quickly retrieve those tools. You wait anxiously and try to figure out another way to fix the <br/>
            wall. Just when you spot them coming back you hear a crack behind you.
        </p>
        <p>The wall starts cracking. You rush to where Belle evacuated the rest of the village and just as you get there <br/>
            the wall completely breaks and all the water comes flooding down. The houses closest to the wall get completely destroyed <br/>
            but the water stops short of flooding the whole village. 
        </p>
        <p>Now you have to help clean up and rebuild. It seems you won't be getting another day off anytime soon.</p>
